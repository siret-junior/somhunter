# SOMHunter opensource

This is an open-source version of the SOMHunter video search and retrieval engine, slightly simplified from the prototype that was featured at Video Browser Showdown 2020 in Daejeon, Korea (see https://videobrowsershowdown.org/ ).

Main features:

- a very simple demonstration dataset is packed in the repository, indexed V3C1 dataset will be available for download
- keyword search, similarity-based search
- several ways of browsing and re-scoring the results (including SOMs)
- VBS-compatible submission and logging API clients

## Installation

Prerequisities:

- a working installation of Node.js with some variant of package manager
  (either `npm` or `yarn`)
- Python 3
- C++ compiler
- `libcurl` (see below for installation on various platforms)

After cloning this repository, change to the repository directory and run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

(Optionally replace `npm` with `yarn`.)

This should open a browser window with the running SOMHunter interface.
Now you can start browsing!

### Getting the dependencies on UNIX systems

You should be able to install all dependencies from the package management. On
Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu and Mint) the following should work:

```
apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev nodejs yarnpkg
```

The build system uses `pkg-config` to find libCURL -- if that fails, either
install the CURL pkgconfig file manually, or customize the build configuration
in `cppsrc/SomHunterWrapper/binding.gyp` to fit your setup.

Similar (similarly named) packages should be available on most other distributions.

### Getting the dependencies on Windows

The build systems expects libCURL to reside in `c:\Program Files\curl\`.  You
may want to install it using
[vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2019) as
follows:

- download and install `vcpkg`
- install and export libCURL:
```
vcpkg install curl:x64-windows
vcpkg export --raw curl:x64-windows
```
- copy the directory with the exported libCURL to `c:\Program Files\`.

Alternatively, you can use any working development installation of libCURL by
filling the appropriate paths in `cppsrc/SomHunterWrapper/binding.gyp`.

### Build problems

We have tested SOMHunter on Windows and several different Linux distributions,
which should cover a majority of target environments. Please report any errors
you encounter using the GitHub issue tracer, so that we can fix them improve
the portability of SOMHunter.

## Datasets

The repository contains a (very small) pre-extracted indexed dataset (see
https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEW.2015.7169765 for dataset details). That should be
ready to use.

We can provide a larger pre-indexed dataset based on the [V3C1 video
collection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05710-7_29),
but do not provide a direct download due to licensing issues. Please contact us
to get a downloadable link.

### Using custom video data

You may set up the locations of the dataset files in `config.json`. The
thumbnails of the extracted video frames must be placed in directory
`public/thumbs/`, so that they are accessible from the browser. (You may want
to use a symbolic link that points to the thumbnails elsewhere, in order to
save disk space and IO bandwidth.)

Extraction of data from custom files proceeds as follows:
